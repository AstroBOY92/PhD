[[Deep Learning for Image Segmentation]]

Script: Deep Learning Image Segmentation on a CMC Sample.py

Highlights

Uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a dense neural network

Trains on the MNIST dataset (as a placeholder for CMC microstructures)

Plots training and validation accuracy across epochs

Output

Accuracy plot of training/testing performance

Final test accuracy printed on console

[[Finite Element Analysis of UHTCs]]

Script: FEA_UTHC_Code (2).py

Module 1 (FEniCS)

Simulates steady-state heat distribution using FEniCS

Solves Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions

Outputs a VTK file and visual plot

Module 2 (Numpy & Scipy)

Implements finite difference method manually

Applies different boundary temperatures on edges

Solves system using linear algebra and plots 2D temperature field

Output

VTK visualization: heat_solution.pvd

Heatmap plot showing temperature distribution

[[ML in Material Science: Regression, Clustering, RL]]

Scripts:

Machine Learning in Material Science example.py

MLExamplesformaterialscience.py

Contains

Supervised Learning: Linear regression fit using synthetic blob data

Unsupervised Learning: KMeans clustering on synthetic 2D dataset

Reinforcement Learning: Illustrative example of states/actions/rewards

Output

Side-by-side visualizations for all 3 ML types

[[Running the Code]]

You can run each script individually in a Python environment. Some notes:

FEniCS script may require a Linux environment or Docker image

TensorFlow script runs on CPU or GPU depending on setup

All scripts produce visual outputs using matplotlib

[[Installation Requirements]]

pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy scikit-learn fenics

Note: FEniCS installation may differ by OS. Use Docker for a portable setup.

[[Future Enhancements]]

Replace MNIST with real CMC/UHTC segmentation datasets

Add UQ (uncertainty quantification) to FEA outputs

Extend ML examples to include SVM, PCA, and deep RL

Package into a modular research framework with CLI/GUI
